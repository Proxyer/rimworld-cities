RimCities is an attempt to create an interesting and unique end-game challenge for RimWorld players. This mod adds randomly generated cities to the world map, which are similar to other settlements but are far more difficult to attack. Pirate-controlled cities provide even more of a challenge by occasionally bombarding you with mortar shells.

It is possible to visit and explore friendly cities with in-person trading and custom quest objectives. Rival factions will attack one another's cities from time to time, giving you opportunities to choose sides and establish military alliances.

You may also come across abandoned cities, which provide great scavenging opportunities for you and other nearby raiding parties.

RimCities is compatible with existing save files and works with Combat Extended, Real Ruins, Zombieland, Faction Control, RimQuest, Quest Tab, Medieval Times, and many other mods. If you're encountering issues, try disabling other mods and/or tweaking the load order.

If you'd like to start your colony in a city, click "Scenario Editor" and check the box next to "Edit mode". From there, click "Add part" and add the "Start in city (RimCities)" option. You can then customize the scenario to your liking.

Work in progress! Let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions for the mod.
